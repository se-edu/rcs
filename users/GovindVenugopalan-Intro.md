Hi my name is Govind Venugopalan.
I am currently Year CS & Mathmematics DDP
I like sports, especially Frisbee, Football and Tchoukball. Oh and Long distance running as well.
I like coding to solve problems (duh), but I am still quite noob. Should probably start building something, so hope this module will teach me that.
Interesting fact: I can sing in Chinese and Korean despite me being an Indian. (SING ONLY!)
That's all. Bye bye.
