Hi I am Shwetha and I hope to prove Dijkstra wrong with the help of this module because my first programming language was GW Basic :)

"It is practically impossible to teach good programming style to students that have had prior exposure to BASIC;
as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration." -Edsger W. Dijkstra
